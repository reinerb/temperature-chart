# React Temperature Chart

I built a display for historical temperature data, queried from the [OpenMeteo Historical Weather API](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/historical-weather-api).

Currently this displays data in my hometown for the year to date.

Hovering each day shows the numerical date and the highest temperature of the day.

Inspired by cross stitch projects like [this one](https://i.redd.it/5i3d4avko2a81.jpg) and the one my partner is working on.
